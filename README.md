# ToursAndTravel
This project implements a Tours and Travel packages service provider using OOP concepts in Java.
It provides a range of packages along with details such as number of days, rate, places included, etc. to the user. 
The user can view the range of options and choose a package based on his preference. 
It includes Domestic as well as International tour packages to choose from. 
On choosing either Domestic or International packages it provides a variety of places which you can visit such as Goa, Sri Lanka, Germany,
etc. along with a short description of each place in the package. It also provides the facility to view all the booked packages.
After entering valid passenger details and completing the booking procedure, it prints a bill containing all the details of the booking. 
This bill is also written to a text file which can be used for printing. Domestic and International bills are written to separate files.
